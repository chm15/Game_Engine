- State synchronization seems to be better suited for ECS than snapshot interpolation.

- State synchronization requires that the server maintains a priority
    accumulator array for each connected client. The priority accumulator array
    would accumulate the priority value of each entity that has a Net component 
    every game tick. When the client acknowledges a Sync message, the server will 
    reset the values for the entities that were sent in the previous Sync message. 
    If the server sends one sync message, then comes back around to send another 
    before the client will respond, the server will ignore any ack responses for 
    the first Sync message since it was invalidated by new data.
