    "You must now tell the server that the entity class should be networked 
    and that a corresponding client class exists with the 
    DECLARE_SERVERCLASS() macro, which will register the class in a global 
    server class list and reserve a unique class ID. Place it in the class 
    definition (i.e. H file). The corresponding macros IMPLEMENT_SERVERCLASS_ST 
    and END_SEND_TABLE() must be placed in the class's implementation (i.e. 
    CPP file) one after another to register the server class and its SendTable 
    (these are covered in the next section)."

Movement:
    
    - Mark as Client_Authoritative
    - On server-side the serialization method could implement rules on max and min values of
        movement-component members.
    - Server could tell the client it's client-id. The client could use this to figure out which movement component to update. 
        The server could use client-id's to determine which movement component to update on the server-side based on the 
        client-id associated with the connection object.
