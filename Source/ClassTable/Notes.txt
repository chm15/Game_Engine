- EngineClass::init() MUST be called before anything can be done with any 
    registered EngineClasses. The purpose of the init method is to allow
    EngineComponents to allocate a ComponentArray using the global Coordinator
    coordinator::g_Coordinator. If this was done through a constructor, there
    would be global constructor wars, and there would be no way to predict
    who would win.

- EngineClass::initializer() can be overridden by any subclasses of EngineClass
    to get a non-global and determinate scope to run initialization code in.

- The class table is used to register classes that can be identifie at run-time
    by the engine. When a class is registered with the DEFINE_ENGINE_CLASS and
    IMPLEMENT_ENGINE_CLASS macros, the class gets className and classID
    variables.

- className is a string of the class's name. If a class called ExampleClass
    were registered, ExampleClass::className would be "ExampleClass".

- classID is a unique int given to the class. It is important that the server
    and client have their classes registered in the same order so that the
    classID's mesh properly.
