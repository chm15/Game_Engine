- The class table is used to register classes that can be identifie at run-time
    by the engine. When a class is registered with the DEFINE_ENGINE_CLASS and
    IMPLEMENT_ENGINE_CLASS macros, the class gets className and classID
    variables.

- className is a string of the class's name. If a class called ExampleClass
    were registered, ExampleClass::className would be "ExampleClass".

- classID is a unique int given to the class. It is important that the server
    and client have their classes registered in the same order so that the
    classID's mesh properly.
