Initialization:

    - EngineClass::init() must be called before any of the registered
        EngineClasses can be used!

    - EngineClass has a virtual member initialization() that can be overridden
        in subclasses to avoid constructor fights amongst globals.
    

Naming conventions:
    Class members:
        - Don't use m_genericMember; use this->genericMember where possible.

    Global variables:
        - Use g_Variable .

    Global constants:
        - Use GENERIC_CONSTANT .
    
    Macros:
        - MY_MACRO()


Subsystems:

    - Systems should have an abstract interface declared in a .h file.
    - Should use a global variable declared in a .cpp file for each system.
    - Source Engine: 
        "Each subsystem defines an abstract interface in a .h file, 
        while typically implementing it and creating a global variable in a .cpp 
        file. Through macros or by simply adding it to the client/server's 
        initialization function, that global variable is added to the list of 
        active systems. Once hooked up, the existing hooks take care of 
        initialization, shutdown, and calling the appropriate update functions 
        as necessary." [https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Engine_Structure]


Improvements:
    - Each system should have an init() method where they have a chance to set
        themselves/any external libraries up. The Game_Engine init() method
        would be responsible for calling each system init methods as well
        as the EngineClass init method.
