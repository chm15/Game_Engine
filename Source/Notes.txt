Naming conventions:
    Class members:
        - Don't use m_genericMember; use this->genericMember where possible.

    Global variables:
        - Use g_GlobalVariable .

    Global constants:
        - Use GLOBAL_CONSTANT .


Subsystems:
    - Systems should have an abstract interface declared in a .h file.
    - Should use a global variable declared in a .cpp file for each system.
    - Source Engine: 
        "Each subsystem defines an abstract interface in a .h file, 
        while typically implementing it and creating a global variable in a .cpp 
        file. Through macros or by simply adding it to the client/server's 
        initialization function, that global variable is added to the list of 
        active systems. Once hooked up, the existing hooks take care of 
        initialization, shutdown, and calling the appropriate update functions 
        as necessary." [https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Engine_Structure]
